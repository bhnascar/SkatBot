SkatBot: CS229 Final Project
============================

Dependencies
------------
Python 3.4.2 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.2/)
Matlab R2011a or newer

Setup
-----
Edit line 6 of globals.py to point to the location of the Matlab executable.

Running
-------
On Windows, double-click "start_server.bat" or "start_client.bat".
On OS X, double-click "start_server.command" or "start_client.command".

Note that the start scripts are set up for local development. That means that it automatically uses the IP address of your computer. If you would like to run the Skat client with a Skat server on a different computer, you must edit the IP address in start_client.bat/command.

Other notes
-----------
Updates for pymatbridge have only been tested on Windows.
