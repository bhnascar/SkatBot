SkatBot: CS229 Final Project
============================

Dependencies
------------
Python 3.4.2 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.2/)

Running
-------
On Windows, double-click "start_server.bat" or "start_client.bat".
On OS X, double-click "start_server.command" or "start_client.command".

Note that the start scripts are set up for local development. That means that it automatically uses the IP address of your computer. If you would like to run the Skat client with a Skat server on a different computer, you must edit the IP address in start_client.bat/command.
