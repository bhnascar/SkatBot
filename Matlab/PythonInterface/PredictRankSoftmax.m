function [y] = PredictRankSoftmax(x)
%PREDICTRANKSOFTMAX Predicts the rank of the card that should be played
%   Y = PREDICTRANKSOFTMAX(X) is the prediction of the rank that should be
%   played. This function takes in a vector X of features and outputs Y,
%   an array of 11 numbers between 1 and 11. The first number is the
